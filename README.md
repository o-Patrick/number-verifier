# number-verifier
 Number verifier webpage developed during one class in the JavaScript "Sintaxe e Operadores" (Syntax and Operations) course tutored by [stebsnusch](https://github.com/stebsnusch) at DIO (Digital Innovation One) 

 The [HTML](https://github.com/o-Patrick/number-verifier/blob/main/index.html) only exists for support. The [JS](https://github.com/o-Patrick/number-verifier/blob/main/num-verifier.js) file have was done by me before seeing [stebsnusch's](https://github.com/stebsnusch/basecamp-javascript/blob/main/sintaxe-e-operadores/comparaNumeros.js) resolution.

 I highly encourage you to check [her original repository](https://github.com/stebsnusch/basecamp-javascript/tree/main/sintaxe-e-operadores) for this course!
